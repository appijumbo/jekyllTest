After a little over a year of development, elementary is proud to announce the stable release of elementary OS Loki!
Loki is the newest version of elementary OS, a design-oriented and open source Linux-based operating system for desktops and laptops. It succeeds Freya which was released in April of 2015.
The previous release of elementary OS was downloaded about 1.2 million times, with 73% of those downloads coming from closed source OSes. elementary founder, Daniel Foré reports,
Rather than competing directly with existing open source projects, elementary seeks to grow the market share for open source software in general. And as we’ve seen with previous releases, that’s exactly what we’re doing.
We’ve closed about 1,000 issue reports and implemented over 20 blueprints. Altogether, these represent stability and security improvements, better internationalization, new features and options, and much more.
