Digestive biscuits are hard, semi-sweet biscuits sometimes known as sweetmeal biscuits. Early recipes called for baking soda, believed to have a positive effect on digestion, hence the name. Digestives are light-brown in colour and have a distinctive malty flavour due to the use of coarse brown wheat flour; other ingredients include sugar, salt, ground wholemeal, vegetable oil or butter, and sometimes milk.
