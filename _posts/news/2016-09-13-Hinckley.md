The government has given the go ahead for a new £18bn nuclear power station in the UK after imposing "significant new safeguards" to protect national security.
The new plant at Hinkley Point in Somerset is being financed by the French and the Chinese.
In exchange, China wants to use its design for new UK nuclear stations.
The Chinese welcomed the decision, saying they were not concerned about new rules on future projects.
